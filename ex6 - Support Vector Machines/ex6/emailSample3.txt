Vinny,

From all of us here at DonorsChoose.org, we hope you have a very happy birthday.

We thought you might enjoy giving a classroom something to celebrate, too. It's our treat!

Here is a $10 DonorsChoose.org gift code to make a teacher's day as happy as yours. Be sure to use it before February 02, 2017 at DonorsChoose.org/redeem.

Have an awesome year!

Sincerely, 
The DonorsChoose.org Team

P.S. You share a birthday with Ms. Jasper, a teacher in Hayward, CA! Here's her classroom project: When Learning is Fun, It Can't Be Undone!.
